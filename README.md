With the introduction of the internet, online usage has expanded, making it important to forecast traffic on web pages in order to control web server loads. One of the most difficult tasks is predicting future traffic on various web sites. Web traffic prediction may be used to support online businesses in a variety of ways. You may prepare for load balancing to be set up on the cloud or server of web sites, understand user behavior, effectively promote items on pages with large visits based on user interests, and spot anomalies, for example. You can also understand user behavior. Forecasting web traffic presents a significant challenge since it might impair the operation of important websites. Research on time-series forecasting has been very active. One of the most challenging issues in the field is predicting time series values in the future. The time series discipline covers a wide range of topics, including inference, analysis, forecasting, and classification. In this paper we explained the two existing models of past which are ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and other one is LSTM RNN (Long Short Term Memory). Also, we described boosting algorithm for LSTM RNN named Adaboost.
